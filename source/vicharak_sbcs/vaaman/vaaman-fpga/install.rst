   .. tab-item:: linux

      The FPGA used on vaaman is efinix's trion T120F324.Efinity IDE is used for  generating the bit/hex stream 
      of your RTL code to run in on FPGA.



      You can download the the software from `here <https://www.efinixinc.com/support/efinity.php>`_.
      (Efinity software provides a free liscense.To get a free license, register at efinix  `Support Center <https://www.efinixinc.com/support/index.php>`_. )

    Download the simulator from `bleyer.org/icarus <https://bleyer.org/icarus>`_.
    <OR>
    To access the source code, visit `github.com/steveicarus/iverilog <https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog>`_.


    **Installing GTKWave**

    GTKWave is an open-source tool used for analyzing post-simulation dumpfiles, providing a graphical interface with a waveform viewer and RTL source code navigator. 
    It's compatible with the iVerilog simulator, making it useful for debugging simulation models and viewing VCD waveform data.

    To download and run the latest Windows version of GTKWave:

    1. Visit `gtkwave - Browse Files at Sourceforge.net <https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/>`_. to locate the Windows files for GTKWave.
    2. Download and unzip the file.
