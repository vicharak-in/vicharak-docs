# U-Boot (Universal Boot Loader)

## What actually is u-boot?

U-Boot `Das U-Boot` is an open-source bootloader that can be used on various
platforms such as ARM, X86, MIPS, RISC-V and many more.
It is the Universal Boot Loader project and is actually used to boot the
Linux kernel in your Vicharak board.

:::{note}
More information on u-boot can be found on [U-Boot Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot).
:::

(mainline-u-boot-important)=

:::{important}

Vicharak provides two different sources of U-Boot for the Vaaman board.

**1. Vendor specific u-boot (u-boot version v2017.09)**

: Vendor specific u-boot is a fork of u-boot provided by Rockchip with
additional features including Vaaman board support.

**2. Mainline u-boot (u-boot version v2023.11)**

: Mainline u-boot is the upstream u-boot maintained by Open-source
developers. It contains the bleeding edge features, SoC improvements and bug fixes.

<br />

There are separate methods to compile and flash u-boot for these above sources.
:::

:::{tip}

It is generally not recommended to use **mainline u-boot** with your Vicharak linux
images. Because those images follows [Rockchip's boot flow](#rockchip-boot-flow).
And things may break due to incompatible changes in mainline u-boot.

Consider the following when choosing:

- Use vendor-specific U-Boot for Vicharak Linux images following Rockchip's boot flow.
- Mainline U-Boot is suitable for custom or community images like _Manjaro ARM, Armbian_, etc.

:::

## Build Vicharak Vaaman u-boot from source

For Vicharak eMMC builds you can follow the `Linux Upgrade Tool` guide

```{seealso} Refer to
[Flash u-boot to eMMC using Rockchip upgrade_tool](../linux-usage-guide/rockchip-upgrade-tool-misc.rst)
```

If you are not using `UMS mode` then make sure you are able to boot your board
using any other storage media. (SD-card, NVMe or even the same eMMC).

To write the vendor U-Boot image to the eMMC, use the following commands.
(Assuming the eMMC is at `/dev/mmcblk1`.)

```bash
sudo dd if=idblock.bin of=/dev/mmcblk1 seek=64; sync
```

```{warning}
The block device `/dev/mmcblk1` may be different as per the board's storage configuration.

Confirm the block device using `parted /dev/mmcblk<X>`.

Alternatively, you can use `lsblk` to find the block device.
```

## Verify the u-boot version

To ensure that U-Boot has been successfully updated, it's essential to verify
the version. Follow these steps:

### Enter the u-boot shell

:::{warning}
Make sure that you have followed the serial console setup in the
[Linux serial console guide](#linux-uart-serial-console).
:::

1. Open your preferred serial console application.

2. Reset or power on the board.

:::{admonition} Developer Note
:class: note

Vaaman's u-boot is configured for development purpose.
It will allow you 3 seconds to enter the u-boot shell before booting the kernel.
:::

3. Quickly press **CTRL+c** when you see some logs starting to appear on the
   console.

If you have followed the above steps successfully, you should be able to access
a u-boot shell or terminal.

:::{admonition} Developer tip
:class: tip

Set `CONFIG_BOOTDELAY` to `0` in `configs/rk3399-vaaman_defconfig` to disable the delay.

And recompile the u-boot.
:::

you can verify the u-boot version by using `version` command.

```bash
version
```

or you can just directly boot the board and see the serial console output during
the initial boot process.

There will be a version string printed on the console during boot up.

```text
U-Boot 2017.09-ge629234bf25-230427 #vicharak (Jul 11 2023 - 16:43:11 +0530)
```

## 2. Build Mainline u-boot from source

#### Installing the required system dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python libssl-dev git-core \
    libgnutls28-dev gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf u-boot-tools device-tree-compiler \
    gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu mtools parted pv
```

#### Getting the Mainline u-boot source

The source code for the mainline u-boot has been published to our
[GitHub organisation](https://github.com/vicharak-in/rockchip-linux-u-boot/tree/vicharak-mainline).

##### Clone the repository using git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vicharak-in/rockchip-linux-u-boot -b vicharak-mainline
```

#### Compile ARM trusted firmware

Before compiling the mainline U-Boot, you need to compile ARM trusted firmware (ATF).
ATF plays a crucial role in the boot process, handling secure and non-secure world transitions.

Follow these steps to compile ATF:

1. Clone the ARM trusted firmware source code from [ARM's git server](https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git) and compile it.

```bash
git clone https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git -b master --depth=1

cd trusted-firmware-a
```

2. Compile ATF using the specified cross-compiler and platform (rk3399).

```bash
make realclean -j$(nproc --all)
make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- PLAT=rk3399 -j$(nproc --all)
```

Upon successful compilation, the `build/` directory will be created.

3. Copy the compiled `bl31.elf` file to the U-Boot directory.

```bash
cp build/rk3399/release/bl31/bl31.elf <u-boot-directory>
```

#### Compile Mainline u-boot

Enter the u-boot directory and compile the u-boot.

```bash
export BL31=bl31.elf

make rk3399-vaaman_defconfig
make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j$(nproc --all)
```

```{note}
Follow the [u-boot USB Mass Storage (UMS) mode](../linux-usage-guide/u-boot-ums.md)
for using eMMC as a USB storage device on your Host computer and for flashing.
```

If you are not using `UMS mode` then make sure you are able to boot your board
using any other storage media. (SD-card, NVMe or even the same eMMC).

To write the mainline U-Boot image to the eMMC, use the following commands.
(Assuming the eMMC is at `/dev/mmcblk1`.)

```bash
sudo dd if=u-boot-rockchip.bin of=/dev/mmcblk1 seek=64; sync
```

````{warning}
For Vicharak provided eMMC/SD-Card images you need to merge partition 1 and 2
into one partition.

**Delete the trust partition**

```bash
sudo parted /dev/mmcblk1 rm 2
```

**Resize the u-boot partition**

```bash
sudo parted /dev/mmcblk1 resizepart 1 100%
```

**Flash the TPL/SPL combined image**

```bash
sudo dd if=u-boot-rockchip.bin of=/dev/mmcblk1 seek=64; sync

````

```{warning}
On Vicharak Vaaman `eMMC` will always be at `/dev/mmcblk1` if you are using
Vicharak provided kernel and u-boot images.

If you are using your own kernel and u-boot images then you may need to
change the block device in the above commands.

To check the block device of the eMMC, run `dmesg | grep mmcblk` in a terminal.
