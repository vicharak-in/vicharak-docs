# Linux SDK

Working with Vicharak computer boards is very easy as we provide all the
necessary source, tools and scripts required to build your own Linux systems.

## Build Linux SDK from source

The Vicharak Linux SDK is based on SDK provided by Rockchip hence, it follows
the conditions and criteria of Rockchip.

Vicharak provides multiple different sources for building your own Linux images.
Take a look at the table below:

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:class: feature-table

-
  - Linux distribution
  - Version

-
  - Debian
  - Bullseye (11)

-
  - Ubuntu
  - Focal (20.04)

-
  - Ubuntu
  - Jammy (22.04)

-
  - Yocto
  - Mickledore (4.2)

-
  - Buildroot
  - None

-
  - Android
  - 12.1

:::

These sources are available at [Vicharak GitHub](https://github.com/vicharak-in)

### Installing the package dependencies for environment setup

```{warning}
It is recommended to either use **Debian bullseye (11)** or
**Ubuntu focal (20.04)** to build the rootfs image.
```

#### Install source control tools

Building Vicharak linux systems requires both **Git** (For source code management)
and **Repo** (Google-built repository management tool).

Please take a look at [Android's source controls tools setup](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download)
as we follow the same for building Vicharak's Linux systems.

#### Install package dependencies

:::{important}
Make sure you have properly installed `repo` tool before proceeding.
:::

**The following packages are required to build the rootfs image.**

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y

sudo apt install -y asciidoc autotools-dev bash bc binutils bison \
build-essential bzip2 chrpath cpio curl cvs dblatex default-jre \
device-tree-compiler diffstat expect-dev fakeroot file flex g++ gawk gcc \
gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g+conf genext2fs git git-core \
git-gui gitk graphviz gzip intltool lib32stdc++6 libdrm-dev libglade2-dev \
libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev liblz4-tool libncurses5 libparse-yapp-perl \
libsigsegv2 libssl-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev m4 make mercurial mtools \
openssh-client parted patch patchutils perl python3 python-is-python3 \
qemu-user-static rsync sed subversion swig tar texinfo u-boot-tools unzip w3m \
wget
```

<!-- TODO: Fix when the issues section is available -->

:::{note}
The above packages might not be available to install on your system. Please
try to find the alternatives or solution from the internet.

If you still are unable to install the packages, please contact us through [issues section](#)
:::

### Getting the sources

We have structured our Linux development source code in the same way as the
official Android sources. i.e. we have various manifests with different
branches for different releases of our supported Linux distributions and products.
**repo** tool will take care of the source code syncing and updating.

Take a look at the following table to get the latest sources.

| Manifest         | Tag                 | URL                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Debian bullseye  | V1.0.2311.000       | https://github.com/vicharak-in/rockchip-linux-manifests/tree/master       |
| Ubuntu Focal     | V1.0.2311.000       | https://github.com/vicharak-in/rockchip-linux-manifests/tree/master       |
| Ubuntu Jammy     | V1.0.2311.000       | https://github.com/vicharak-in/rockchip-linux-manifests/tree/master       |
| Yocto Mickledore | V1.0.2311.000       | https://github.com/vicharak-in/rockchip-linux-manifests/tree/master       |
| Buildroot        | V1.0.2311.000       | https://github.com/vicharak-in/rockchip-linux-manifests/tree/master       |
| Android 12.1     | android-12.1-v1.0.0 | https://github.com/vicharak-in/rockchip-rockchip-linux-manifests/tree/android-12.1 |

## Understanding Firmware Formats

There are two primary types of firmware formats you'll encounter:

1. **Raw Firmware:**
   - **Description:** Raw Firmware is essentially a direct copy of your storage device, capturing every bit of data as is.
   - **Flashing Tools:**
     - _For SD Card:_
       - **GUI Tools:**
         - `SDCard Installer` (Linux/Windows/MacOS)
         - `Balena Etcher` (Linux/Windows/MacOS)
       - **CLI Tool:**
         - `dd` (Linux)
     - _For eMMC:_
       - **GUI Tool:**
         - `AndroidTool/RKDevTool` (Windows)
       - **CLI Tools:**
         - `upgrade_tool` (Linux/MacOS)
         - `rkdeveloptool` (Linux)

2. **RK Firmware:**
   - **Description:** RK Firmware comes in Rockchip's proprietary format. Specific tools provided by Rockchip are used to flash this firmware onto eMMC or SD Card.
   - **Flashing Tools:**
     - _For SD Card:_
       - **GUI Tool:**
         - `SD Firmware Tool` (Windows)
     - _For eMMC:_
       - **GUI Tool:**
         - `AndroidTool/RKDevTool` (Windows)
       - **CLI Tool:**
         - `upgrade_tool` (Linux)

**Partition Image:**

- **Description:** Partition Image refers to segmented images of different
  parts of the firmware, such as boot.img, kernel.img, and system.img.
  These components are assembled like pieces of a puzzle to form a complete Android system.

- **Usage:**
  - Place each specific image (e.g., kernel.img) into its corresponding
    partition on the SD card or eMMC to construct the complete Android system.

:::

### Pack the firmware into a single image

````{admonition} Important
:class: note

Please make sure that the `tools/linux/Linux_Pack_Firmware/rockdev/package-file` is the correct package file.

The partition information in the package file is very important.
If the partition information is incorrect, the firmware will not be able to boot normally.

The packed firmware image will be located in the `rockdev/pack/` directory.

##### Rockhip Pack Firmware Image (RK Firmware)

Rockchip provides a tool called `Linux_Pack_Firmware` to pack the firmware into a single image.
It uses Rockchip's own image format,
and can be used to flash the firmware to the eMMC of the development board or any SD-card using the tools provided by Rockchip.

```bash
./build.sh updateimg
```


```{seealso} Learn more about the Rockchip parameter.txt file\
[Rockchip parameter.txt](./rockchip-parameter-file.md)
```
````

---

### Vicharak RAW (GPT) Image (Raw Firmware)

Vicharak provides another method to pack the firmware into a single image.
This script uses the GPT image format, and can be used to flash the firmware to
any supported storage media (SD-Card, eMMC or NVMe) using the basic linux
utility such as `dd` or even using `Balena Etcher` tool.

```{seealso}
[How to use Balena Etcher](../../vaaman-sdcard-boot.rst)
```

```bash
./build.sh rawimg
```

```{admonition} More information
For more information about the `Linux_Pack_Firmware` tool or how to flash
firmware on to your board, please refer to the following link.\
