# Linux Upgrade Tool (upgrade_tool)

## What is Linux Upgrade Tool

Rockchip's **Linux Upgrade tool** is a proprietary solution developed by
Rockchip for flashing images onto various storage devices such as `SPI`,
`eMMC`, `SD-card`, and more. Unlike open-source
[rkdeveloptool](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkdeveloptool) software,
this tool does not provide access to its source code.

Instead, it is distributed solely in **binary executable** form,
allowing users to utilize the provided executable files for the purpose of
flashing images onto their desired storage devices.

## How to use Linux Upgrade Tool

### Installing required system dependencies

Linux Upgrade Tool requires the following dependencies to be installed on your Debian or Ubuntu system.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

---

For other Linux distributions, please refer to the following table for the equivalent package names.

|  Debian/Ubuntu   |    Fedora    | Arch Linux |
| :--------------: | :----------: | :--------: |
|   libudev-dev    |              |            |
| libusb-1.0-0-dev | libusb-devel |   libusb   |

**Download the Linux_Upgrade_Tool from [Vicharak GitHub](https://github.com/vicharak-in/Linux_Upgrade_Tool)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vicharak-in/Linux_Upgrade_Tool
```

### Booting the board into MaskROM mode

:::{tip}
**MaskROM mode** is a special mode that allows the board to be flashed with new firmware.
:::

To boot the board into MaskROM mode, follow the steps below:

1. Connect the board to your computer using a **USB-C** cable.

2. Short the `eMMC CLK` on the board to `GND` using a **tweezer** or a **jumper wire**.

:::{admonition} **Alternative Options to boot into MaskROM mode**
:class: tip

You can Refer to the [Alternative MaskROM boot modes](#vaaman-maskrom-mode) for more information.
:::

3. After shorting the `eMMC CLK` to `GND`, You can now release the Pogo pin.

4. Confirm that the board is in MaskROM mode by running the following command:

:::{card} sudo ./upgrade_tool ld

```bash
List of rockusb connected(1)

DevNo=1 Vid=0x2207,Pid=0x330c,LocationID=7143 Mode=Maskrom SerialNo=
```

```

:::{tip}
You can use the above command by using `sudo ./upgrade_tool` prefix before any of the command.

**For example to erase flash:**

1. Setup the device into MaskROM mode. Refer to the [How to enter Maskrom Mode](#booting-the-board-into-maskrom-mode) for more details.
2. Run the following command to check if the device is in MaskROM mode:

:::{card} sudo ./upgrade_tool ld

```bash
List of rockusb connected(1)

DevNo=1 Vid=0x2207,Pid=0x330c,LocationID=7143 Mode=Maskrom SerialNo=
```

:::

3. Run the following command to erase the flash:

```bash
sudo ./upgrade_tool ef <firmware file>
```

Example:

```bash
sudo ./upgrade_tool ef V1.0.2311.000-vicharak-debian-bullseye-xfce-emmc.img
```

:::

::::

:::{important} Understand the firmware file formats before flashing

See the [**Firmware File Formats**](#firmware-file-formats)
:::

## Flashing RAW Image (Raw firmware) using upgrade_tool

:::{tip}
RAW images can be flashed to any storage devices such as SD card, NVMe or eMMC
using the `dd` command or the `Linux_Upgrade_Tool`.

In the following example we will use the `dd` command to flash the RAW image
to the on-board eMMC on Vicharak Vaaman.
:::

### Check for connected devices

:::{card} sudo ./upgrade_tool ld

```bash
List of rockusb connected(1)

DevNo=1 Vid=0x2207,Pid=0x330c,LocationID=7143 Mode=Maskrom SerialNo=
```

:::

### Flash the miniloader loader binary

:::{card} sudo ./upgrade_tool db rk3399_loader_xxx.bin

```bash
Download boot ok.
```

:::

### Writing the RAW GPT Image (Raw Firmware) to the storage device

:::{danger}
Make sure to flash the loader first to the storage device.
:::

:::{card} sudo ./upgrade_tool wl 0 <some_gpt_image>.img

Example:

```bash
sudo ./upgrade_tool wl 0 V1.0.2311.000-vicharak-debian-bullseye-xfce-raw.img
```

```bash
Write LBA OK.
```

:::

### Reboot the device

:::{card} sudo ./upgrade_tool rd

```bash
[sudo] password for vicharak:

Reset Device Success!
```

:::

:::{tip}
If you encounter **Reset Device Fail!** then try to manually reboot using the
power button on the board or else try removing and re-inserting the USB
power cable.
:::

---

:::{tip}
**Alternatively you can directly flash update image to eMMC using
`RK Firmware` method.**

`RK Firmware` method can be used to flash the firmware to the eMMC of the
development board or any SD-card using the tools provided by Rockchip.
:::

{#flash-update-img}

## Flash eMMC Image using (RK Firmware) method

:::{card} sudo ./upgrade_tool uf <some_rockchip_image>.img

Example:

```bash
sudo ./upgrade_tool uf V1.0.2311.000-vicharak-debian-bullseye-xfce-emmc.img
```

```bash
[sudo] password for vicharak:
Loading firmware...
