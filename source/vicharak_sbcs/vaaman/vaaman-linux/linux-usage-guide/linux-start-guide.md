# Vicharak Linux Start Guide

Vicharak Provides multiple linux distributions for Vaaman SBC such as Debian, Ubuntu, Armbian, etc.
This guide will help you to get started with Vicharak linux systems.

## System Management

### Set host name and password

:::{note}
**If you have installed Vicharak Debian or Ubuntu system from the official website,
the default account name and password is:**

username: vicharak

password: 12345
:::

### Vicharak Configuration Tool

Vicharak linux systems includes **vicharak-config** tool which is purely written
using shell scripts that allows users to configure and setup their linux system configuration.

It provides a **TUI** interface to configure different linux specific configurations.
Use `sudo vicharak-config` to get started.

It is supported on all Debian based systems such as Debian buster/bullseye,
Ubuntu focal/jammy and other third party systems such as Armbian.

:::{admonition} Refer to
:class: tip
[**Vicharak config tool guide**](#vicharak-config-tool) for more detailed information.

### Set up automatic Wi-Fi connection on boot

In the following example, we will set up automatic Wi-Fi connection on boot for the
**wlan0** interface. This will be useful if you are using a headless system. That means
you will not need to connect a monitor, keyboard, or mouse to your system to connect to Wi-Fi.

**1. Edit the `/userdata/before.txt` file and add the following lines:**

```text
connect-wi-fi <network name> <password>
```

Example:

```text
connect-wi-fi my-wifi-network my-wifi-password
```

**2. Reboot the system.**

### UART Serial Console

:::{admonition} Windows users refer to
Getting Started with Vaaman [**UART Serial Console**](../../getting-started.rst#using-serial-console)
:::

#### Preparation

To access Vaaman SBC through the serial interface, A USB to TTL serial cable or adapter is required.

[Get arduino compatible FTDI from here](https://amzn.eu/d/hctdJnp)

#### Hardware Setup

1. Connect the USB to TTL serial cable or adapter to your computer.

2. Connect the serial cable or adapter to the Vaaman SBC.

::::{tab-item} GTK-Term (GUI)

#### Install GTK-Term

You can install GTK-Term by executing the following command:

|       Debian/Ubuntu        |           Fedora           |        Arch Linux        |
| :------------------------: | :------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|     `sudo apt update`      |     `sudo dnf update`      |    `sudo pacman -Syu`    |
| `sudo apt install gtkterm` | `sudo dnf install gtkterm` | `sudo pacman -S gtkterm` |

#### Setting up GTK-Term

Run **GTK-Term** by executing the following command:

```bash
sudo gtkterm
```

#### Configure GTK-Term

To access the configuration settings for GTK-Term,
you can follow either of these methods:

Click on the **Configuration** menu and select **Port**.

OR

Press **Ctrl+Shift+S**.

By using either of these methods, you will be able to access the configuration settings in GTK-Term,
where you can make adjustments to the port settings for your serial connection, as shown in the image below:

:::

:::{note}
Ensure that the cable is properly connected to the appropriate serial port on both devices.

::::{tab-item} Minicom (CLI)
:selected: true

#### Install Minicom

For Linux we will use Minicom. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install minicom
```

For other Linux distributions, please refer to the following table for the equivalent package names.

|       Debian/Ubuntu        |           Fedora           |        Arch Linux        |
| :------------------------: | :------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|     `sudo apt update`      |     `sudo dnf update`      |    `sudo pacman -Syu`    |
| `sudo apt install minicom` | `sudo dnf install minicom` | `sudo pacman -S minicom` |

#### Setting up Minicom

- Connect the USB to UART converter to your computer and run the following command to find the port name:

```bash
sudo minicom -s
```

**Select `Serial port setup` and press Enter.**

| Exit                     |
| Exit from Minicom        |
+--------------------------+
```

**Change the port name to the one you found in the previous step.**

For example, if the port name is `/dev/modem`, then change it to `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

## SSH Tutorial

:::{admonition} Windows users refer to
Getting Started with Vaaman [**Using SSH**](../../getting-started.rst#using-ssh)
:::

### SSH Client installation

This guide will cover the installation of default `openssh-server`.

|           Debian/Ubuntu           |              Fedora               |        Arch Linux        |
| :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|         `sudo apt update`         |         `sudo dnf update`         |    `sudo pacman -Syu`    |
| `sudo apt install openssh-client` | `sudo dnf install openssh-client` | `sudo pacman -S openssh` |

### SSH Server installation

|           Debian/Ubuntu           |              Fedora               |        Arch Linux        |
| :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|         `sudo apt update`         |         `sudo dnf update`         |    `sudo pacman -Syu`    |
| `sudo apt install openssh-server` | `sudo dnf install openssh-server` | `sudo pacman -S openssh` |

### SSH Server Configuration

**Enable SSH service to start on boot**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

**Start SSH service**

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

**Check SSH service status**

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

:::{note}
If it is active and running, you should see a **active (running)** message.
:::

**Check SSH service port**

```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep ssh
```

**Avahi-daemon installation and configuration**

You can install **Avahi-daemon** using the following commands:

|          Debian/Ubuntu          |             Fedora              |       Arch Linux       |
| :-----------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :--------------------: |
|        `sudo apt update`        |        `sudo dnf update`        |   `sudo pacman -Syu`   |
| `sudo apt install avahi-daemon` | `sudo dnf install avahi-daemon` | `sudo pacman -S avahi` |

After the installation, **Avahi-daemon** should start automatically.
If it does not, you can start it manually by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon
```

**Verify its status by running:**

```bash
sudo systemctl status avahi-daemon
```

**Access Vaaman SBC through SSH**

**you can use either of the following commands:**

> SSH using the IP address

```bash
ssh username@ip_address
```

:::{tip}
Replace **"username"** with the appropriate username for Vaaman and **"ip_address"** with the
actual IP address assigned to Vaaman on the network.
:::

> SSH using the PC name (hostname)

```bash
ssh username@pc-name.local
```

:::{tip}
Replace **"username"** with the appropriate username for Vaaman and **"pc-name"** with the
actual PC name assigned to Vaaman on the network.
