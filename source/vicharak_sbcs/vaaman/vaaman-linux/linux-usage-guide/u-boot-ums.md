# U-Boot UMS

**USB Mass Storage (UMS)** mode is a feature that allows a device to function like
an external USB storage device when connected to a computer.

In UMS mode, the device's internal storage, such as eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard),
is made accessible to the computer, similar to how you would connect a
USB drive or SD card to your computer.

This mode is useful for tasks like transferring files, flashing firmware,
or writing disk images to the device's storage.

Now, here are the steps for booting into UMS mode from either internal eMMC
storage or SD card:

## Booting into UMS Mode from Internal eMMC Storage:

- Connect the device to a PC using a USB cable.
- Connect the Serial to TTL converter (FTDI) to your board and to the Host
  computer.
- Open the serial monitor application on your Host computer.

[Serial Console Programs](#minicom-guide)
:::

- Power on the device.
- Quickly press `Ctrl + c` to enter the U-Boot console.
- From U-Boot console type `ums 1 mmc <dev number>`, where <dev number> is the device number for MMC card.

ums - Use the UMS [USB Mass Storage]

Usage:
ums <USB_controller> [<devtype>] <dev[:part]> e.g. ums 0 mmc 0
devtype defaults to mmc

```

:::

:::{note}
MMC device number is pre-configured from kernel device tree.

- `mmc0` is the device number for SD-Card.
- `mmc1` is the device number for eMMC.
  :::

- The device will automatically boot into UMS mode, allowing you to share its
  internal storage like a USB drive.

UMS: LUN 0, dev 1, hwpart 0, sector 0x0, count 0x3a3e000
```

:::

- Check kernel logs on your Host computer, and you should be able to see a new
  Storage device added.

:::{note}
With UMS mode, you can easily access and manage the device's storage from your
computer, making it convenient for tasks that involve transferring or writing
data to the device.
:::

After successfully entering UMS mode, you should be able to access your eMMC
from your host computer. You are now ready to flash or copy different things
to your Vicharak board's eMMC using your PC.

Check using `lsblk` command to find the eMMC storage; it should appear as `sdX`
where `X` is an alphabetic letter (e.g., `sdc`).

Check using `parted /dev/sdc` to list the various partitions available on the
eMMC.

:::{tip}
You can directly mount the eMMC `boot` and `root` partition on your host computer.

1. Find the partition that you want to mount. (assuming `/dev/sdc4` is the
   `boot` partition).

2. Use the linux `mount` command to access your partition.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p mountpoint
   mount /dev/sdb1 mountpoint
   ```

3. You can change the kernel images directly just by copying them to `mountpoint`
   folder.

:::

:::{warning}
Do not insert SD-Card when after you previously entered UMS mode from eMMC.
U-Boot might crash in such case.

Always reset the board before switching the storage for UMS mode.
