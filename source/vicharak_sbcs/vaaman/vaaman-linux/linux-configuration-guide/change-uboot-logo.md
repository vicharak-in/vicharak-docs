# How to change U-Boot Logo

**To change the U-Boot logo, you'll need to follow these steps:**

- Prepare your new logo.

:::{attention}
Ensure that your logo is in the BMP (Bitmap) format, with a colour depth of 24 bits (RGB).
The logo size should be less than 1MB to fit within the constraints of U-Boot.
:::

- Convert the logo to the correct format:

:::{tip}
If your logo is not already in the correct format,
you can use an image editing software like GIMP or Photo-shop to convert it.
Open the logo in the software, adjust the colour depth to 24 bits, and save it in BMP format.
:::

- Access the U-Boot source code: Obtain the U-Boot source code for Vaaman from Vicharak [U-Boot GitHub repository](https://github.com/vicharak-in/u-boot-vicharak).

- Locate the logo file: In the U-Boot source code, navigate to the `drivers/video/drm/` where the logo file is contained.
  The logo file is typically named logo.h or similar.

- Converting BMP file to logo.h (Using vicharak `bmp2hex` tool).

```bash
./tools/bmp2hex logo.bmp

mv logo.h drivers/video/drm/logo.h
```

- Recompile U-Boot: Recompile the U-Boot source code with your new logo.
  Follow the instructions provided with the U-Boot source code to build it for your specific board or device.

- Flash the new U-Boot image: Once you have successfully compiled the U-Boot source code,
  you'll need to flash the new U-Boot image to your device.

:::{note}
The flashing process depends on the specific board you are using.
Refer to the Vaaman's documentation or the U-Boot documentation for instructions on how to flash the new image.
:::

- Test the new logo: After flashing the new U-Boot image, reboot your device.
  You should now see your custom logo during the U-Boot boot-up process.
