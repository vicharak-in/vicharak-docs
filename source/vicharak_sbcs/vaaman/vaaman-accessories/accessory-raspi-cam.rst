You can use the Raspberry Pi Camera Module ``v1`` and ``v2`` with the
Vicharak Vaaman. The ``raspi`` camera module is a small circuit board
that connects to the CSI connector on the Vaaman and allows you to take
photos and videos.

We do not build or design the camera module, but we do test it for
compatibility with our Vaaman. We recommend buying the original camera
module from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, or from one of our authorized
resellers.

You can find more information about the camera module on the `Raspberry
Pi Camera documentation
<https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html>`_.

Buy the `Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2
<https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/>`_.

        **Introduction**
        
        This documentation provides instructions on how to run the Python to open the camera frame and capture an image using OpenCV.
        
        |
        **Pre-Requisites**
        
       
        1. Python3 installed on your system.
        
        2. OpenCV library installed (`opencv-python`).  
        
        3. Any Text Editor Software like, Vim, gedit, nano etc.

        
            To Install Vim:
            
            .. code-block::
        
                sudo apt update
                sudo apt install vim
            
            To Install Gedit:

            .. code-block::
                
                sudo apt update

        |    
        **Setup**
 

        1. Attach the camera along with FPC50 15 Pin 1mm pitch cable to the CSI connector.
         
            .. image:: ./../../../_static/images/Camera_guide_0.webp
                :width:  50%
        
        2. Install Python if not already installed. You can download Python from the official website: `Python Downloads <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.

             for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):   

             .. code-block::

                        sudo apt update
                        sudo apt install python3-pip
        
        3. Install the OpenCV library using pip
        
             for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):
             
             .. code-block::

                        pip install opencv-python
        
        |
        **Execution of Program**

        1. Open a terminal window(``Ctrl+Alt+T``).
  
        2. To create a (``.py``) file in vim editor, Run command ``vim <file_name>.py`` in terminal. 

        3. Copy this below content into the file and paste it by pressing ``Ctrl + Shift + v``, then press ``Esc`` and to save this file, type ``:wq``.

        
           .. code-block::

                        # !/bin/env python3
                        import cv2
                        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
                        while True:
                            ret, frame = cap.read()
                            cv2.imshow('frame', frame)
                            if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                                break
                        # After the loop release the cap object
                        cap.release()
                        # Destroy all the windows
                        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
                       
        4. Open a terminal window(``Ctrl+Alt+T``).

        5. Navigate to the directory where your Python program is located using the ``cd`` command.

        6. Run Python program using the following command:

           .. code-block::

                        python3 <file_name>.py

           If you have multiple versions of Python installed, ensure you use ``python3`` to run the program for Python 3.x.
        
    
        |
        **Expected Behavior**


        1. Upon running the program, the camera frame will open.

           .. image:: ./../../../_static/images/python-script-camera-frame.webp
              :alt: Image Description
              :width: 650
        
        2. Press the ``Ctrl+S`` key on your keyboard to capture an image.

           .. image:: ./../../../_static/images/python-script-save-image.webp
              :alt: Image Description
              :width: 650

        3. The captured image will be saved in the current directory unless the directory location has been changed.

        4. Press the key ``Q`` on your keyboard to exit the camera frame.

        **Troubleshooting**
        

        - If you encounter any errors related to missing modules or libraries, ensure that Python and OpenCV are properly installed on your system.
        - If the camera frame does not open or the program does not behave as expected, check for any
          errors in the terminal output and review your program for potential issues.
