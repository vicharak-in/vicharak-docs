Getting Started with Vaaman
===========================

   :alt: Vaaman Overview

Turning the Board On
--------------------

1. **Connect Power:**
    - Connect the PD cable to the Vaaman board.
    - Plug the PD adapter into a power socket.

2. **Power Source:**
    - Ensure you use the provided 12V/5A Power Adapter with PD cable.
    - **Do not use a 5V power input.**

    .. danger::
        | **12V Power Input only! Do not use 5V power input.**
        | Using a 12V power input is crucial for the proper functioning of the Vaaman.
        | The board is designed to operate with a 12V power supply, and using a 5V power
        | input may lead to instability and potential damage.

3. **Automatic Power On:**
    - Once the power is connected, the board will automatically turn on.

4. **Boot Priority:**
    - **NVMe**: Highest precedence. If an NVMe drive is connected, the board boots from it.
    - **SD-card**: If no NVMe drive, the board attempts to boot from an SD-card.
    - **eMMC**: Default. If no NVMe drive or SD-card, the board boots from eMMC storage.

    .. warning::
       | **Remove SD-card if inserted**
       | This ensures the board boots from the eMMC storage.

   :alt: Vaaman power connection

Vaaman is pre-installed with Ubuntu 22 (``Jammy``) on its eMMC storage, so it will boot from the eMMC storage by default.


Verify the Power LED
--------------------

- **Red LED**: Indicates that Vaaman is receiving power.
- Check the red LED for immediate visual confirmation of successful power connection.

.. image:: ../../_static/images/rk3399-vaaman/vaaman-power-led.webp
   :width: 40%
   :alt: Vaaman power LED

Verify the Status LED
---------------------

- **Blue LED**: Blinks to indicate the completion of the booting process.
- Check the blue LED to ensure Vaaman has successfully booted and is ready for configuration.

.. image:: ../../_static/images/rk3399-vaaman/vaaman-blue-led.webp

   :alt: Vaaman status LEDs

.. warning::
   | Please ensure you wait for the system to complete its reboot.
   | The system requires configuration adjustments before you proceed to the next step.
   | Allowing the system to finish restarting ensures it is fully set up for subsequent tasks.

How to Access Your Vaaman Board?
================================

There are multiple ways to access your Vaaman board:

- Connect to a monitor using the **micro HDMI port**.
- Connect headless to your computer using **SSH** or **serial console**.

For the initial setup process, we recommend connecting the Vaaman to a monitor using the **micro HDMI port**. Once the initial setup is complete, you can connect the Vaaman to your computer using the USB-C port.

.. note::
    If you want to access the **serial console**,
    Skip to the :ref:`Serial Console <serial-console>` section.

    If you want to access the **Vaaman using SSH**,
    Skip to the :ref:`SSH <ssh_login>` section.

1. Using Micro HDMI Port
------------------------

- **Micro HDMI Port:** Connect Vaaman to a monitor or TV using a micro HDMI to HDMI cable or adapter.
- **Benefits:** Provides direct visual access to the graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI).

.. image:: ../../_static/images/rk3399-vaaman/vaaman-hdmi.webp
   :width: 50%
   :alt: Vaaman HDMI connection

.. caution::
   | Only a single video port is available on the Vaaman board.
   | You can use either HDMI, DisplayPort, or MIPI-DSI port at a time.

**Steps:**

1. Connect the micro HDMI to HDMI cable to the Vaaman and the monitor.

2. The Vaaman will automatically detect the monitor and display the output.

.. admonition:: Check out Linux Start Guide
   :class: tip

   Once the Vaaman is connected to the monitor, you can follow the
   :ref:`Linux Start Guide <linux-start-guide>` to complete the initial setup.

.. _serial-console:

2. Using Serial Console
------------------------

- **Serial Console:** Access the system's console or terminal interface via UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) pins.
- **Use Case:** Often used for debugging, troubleshooting, or accessing the system when other interfaces are not available.

**Steps:**

1. Connect to the serial pins using a serial cable or adapter.

2. Access the system's console through the connected serial interface.

.. _ssh_login:

Default Login Credentials
-------------------------

- Username: **vicharak**
- Password: **12345**

These credentials are used for initial login via any access method (HDMI, SSH, Serial Console).

3. Using SSH
------------

- **SSH Access:** Securely access Vaaman over a network.

**Steps:**

1. Ensure Vaaman is connected to the network.
2. Open a terminal on your computer.
3. Use the following command to connect: **ssh vicharak@<Vaaman_IP_address>**
4. Enter the default password **12345** when prompted.

Preparation
-----------

To access Vaaman through the serial interface, you will need:

1. A computer with a serial terminal application installed, such as PuTTY or minicom.
2. A USB to UART serial cable or adapter (e.g., FTDI or PL2303).
3. A Micro USB or USB-C cable.
4. A 4-pin jumper wire.

Hardware Setup

.. _ssh:

3. Using SSH
-------------

Vaaman supports **SSH (Secure Shell)**, enabling secure remote access to the system. By establishing an SSH connection, users can remotely connect to Vaaman from another device over a network, such as a computer or smartphone. This method provides a secure command-line interface to administer, configure, and execute commands on Vaaman.

Install OpenSSH server
======================

You can install both OpenSSH components on Windows devices using the **Windows Settings**.

To install the OpenSSH components, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings menu and click on Apps, then select **Optional Features**.
2. Check if OpenSSH is already installed. If not, at the top of the page, click on **Add a feature**, then:

- Find OpenSSH Client and click on Install.
- Find OpenSSH Server and click on Install.

3. After installation, verify that OpenSSH is listed in **Apps and Optional Features**.
4. Open the Services desktop app (Start > type services.msc in the search box > click on the Service app or press ENTER).
5. In the details pane, double-click on **OpenSSH SSH Server**.
6. On the General tab, choose **Automatic** from the Startup type drop-down menu.
7. To start the service, click on **Start**.

Verify OpenSSH server
=====================

Once installed, you can connect to the OpenSSH Server from a Windows device with the OpenSSH client installed.

From a PowerShell prompt, run the following command:

.. code-block:: powershell

    ssh username@ip_address

Example:

.. code-block:: powershell

    ssh vicharak@192.168.29.69

.. tip::

    To find your IP address on Windows, use the following command: ``ipconfig``.
    For Linux users, use the following command: ``ip a``.

Accessing Vaaman through SSH
============================

To access Vaaman via SSH, you can use either of the following commands:

1. SSH using the IP address

- Replace **ip_address** with the actual IP address assigned to Vaaman on the network.

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh vicharak@ip_address


2. SSH using the PC name (hostname)

- Replace **"pc-name"** with the actual PC name assigned to Vaaman on the network.

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh vicharak@pc-name.local


.. tip::
    The default username is **"vicharak"** and the default password is **"12345"**.

4. Set up automatic Wi-Fi connection on boot
--------------------------------------------

1. Edit the ``/usr/lib/vicharak-config/conf.d/before.txt`` file.

   - Add the following line:
     ``
     connect_wi-fi <network name> <password>
     ``

     Example:
     ``
     connect_wi-fi vicharak_5g vcaa_g123
     ``

2. Reboot the system.

- **Vaaman Boot modes**


.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Boot Mode**
     - **Description**
   * - Normal Mode
     - Normal boot mode is the default boot mode. In this mode, the board boots
       from the `eMMC` or `SD-card`. Each partition loads in order and enters
       the system normally.
   * - Loader Mode
     - Loader mode is used to upgrade the `bootloader`. In this mode, the
       bootloader will wait for the host command for `firmware upgrade`.
       On success, the board boots from the `eMMC` or `SD-card`,
       and the board enters the system normally.
   * - Maskrom Mode
     - | Maskrom mode is used to `repair` the board. In a situation where the
         bootloader is damaged, the board can enter the maskrom mode.
         In general, there is no need to enter `Maskrom` mode.
         In this mode, the bootrom code waits for the host to transmit the
         bootloader code through the USB-C port, load and run it.
       | :ref:`Learn more about maskrom mode <vaaman-maskrom-mode>`.
