                5. Finally, press **w** to write the changes to the disk.


Download the bootable image
---------------------------

Obtain the bootable image or operating system files for your desired platform.

.. note::
    | For Vaaman, you can download the bootable image from the :ref:`Downloads <downloads>` page.
    | The bootable image is available in the `SD-card` section.

Write the image to the SD-card
------------------------------

.. warning::
    | Make sure you have selected the correct SD-card before writing the image.
    | Writing the image to the wrong SD-card will erase all the data on the SD-card.

You can use any disk imaging tool such as Etcher or Win32 Disk Imager to write the image to the SD-card.

For demonstration purposes, we will use the **Balena Etcher tool** to write the image to the SD-card.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Balena Etcher (GUI)

        1. Open the **Balena Etcher** tool.

        |

        2. Click on **Select Image** and select the image file.

        .. image:: _static/images/balena-select-image.webp
           :width: 50%

        |

        3. Click on **Select Target** and select the SD-card.

           :width: 50%

        |

        4. Click on **Flash** to start writing the image to the SD-card.

           :width: 50%

        |

        5. Once the writing process is complete, click on **Done**.

        .. image:: _static/images/balena-flash-complete.webp
           :width: 50%

    .. tab-item:: UNIX **dd** command (CLI)

        1. Open the **terminal** and run the following command to write the image to the SD-card:

        .. code-block:: console

            sudo dd if=/path/to/image of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress; sync

        .. note::
            | Replace **/path/to/image** with the path to the image file.
            | You can use the **lsblk** command to list the available disks.
            | In the above command, sd**X** is the name of the Storage drive.
            | **`X`** is the number of the Storage drive, it starts from a.

        2. Wait for the writing process to complete.

        3. Once the writing process is complete, Safely eject the **SD-card** from your computer.

Boot from the SD-card
---------------------

After writing the image to the SD-card, follow these steps to boot from the SD-card:

1. Safely eject the **SD-card** from your computer.

2. Insert the **SD-card** into your Vaaman SBC.

|

3. **Power-on** the device to initiate the boot process from the SD-card.

Connect the PD cable to the Vaaman SBC and the PD adapter to the power socket.
Once the power is connected, the board will automatically turn on.
