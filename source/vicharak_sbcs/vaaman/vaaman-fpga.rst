    .. tab-item:: Uploading BIT files to FPGA

        To upload the BIT file to the FPGA, follow the steps mentioned
        below:

        1. Hardware Connections
        
           Locate the 10-pin headers on the Vaaman board. These can be found from
           the schematic.
        
           Ensure the Vaaman board is powered On.
        
           Connect the USB-to-JTAG Module to the Vaaman board.
        
           While connecting the Programmer module, make sure to follow the
           indicated color code as shown in the image.

        2. Download the BIT file
        
           Download the DEMO BIT file from the `Simple LED Blink Bit Demo <../../_static/files/sample_led_blink_t120_demo_bit.zip>`_
        
           Unzip the downloaded file.
        
        3. Programming the Flash using Efinity
        
           Open Efinity 2021.2 or later.
        
           Inside the Efinity IDE
        
           -  Refresh USB Target as shown in the image.
           -  Select the Bitstream file to be programmed. (The bitstream file is
              available in the unzipped folder)
           -  Select the JTAG Programming mode.
           -  Start the programming process.

           Wait for the programming to complete. When the programming is complete,
           the FPGA will be configured with the bitstream.

    .. tab-item:: Configure fpga from linux command
        
        - Download the HEX file
        - Download the DEMO HEX file from `Simple LED Blink Hex Demo <../../_static/files/sample_led_blink_t120_demo_hex.zip>`_
        - Unzip the downloaded file.
       
        - To program the FPGA from the command line, enter the command:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sudo vaaman-ctl -i <path/to/sample_led_blink_t120_demo_hex.hex>

        - You can get the usage information of the vaaman-ctl tool by using the command:
        
        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo vaaman-ctl -h
            

Verify the FPGA configuration
=============================

Once the programming is complete, you will observe the orange LED on the
Vaaman board blinking.

This indicates that the FPGA is configured with the bitstream.

.. tip::

   Additionally, you will notice that the four green LEDs on the Vaaman
   board will be blinking in a sequence.
