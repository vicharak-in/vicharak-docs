 Vaaman Maskrom Mode
#####################

The Vicharak Vaaman board has a special mode called "Maskrom mode."
In this mode, the board can receive commands through a USB connection.
This is useful for tasks like programming and setting up the device.

In Maskrom mode, the Vaaman board can be accessed through multiple pathways,
allowing users flexibility in how they enter this specialized mode.
This mode serves as a bridge between your computer and the board,
facilitating firmware updates, system configurations, and other critical operations.

When you're in Maskrom mode, it's important to follow the steps in this guide
carefully to make sure everything goes smoothly.

This guide will explain how to put your Vicharak Vaaman board into Maskrom mode
using different methods. This will help you make the most of this versatile
single board computer, even if you're new to these things.


Pre-Requisites
---------------

- Vicharak Vaaman board
- Type-C Power Delivery Adapter
- USB to TTL Serial Converter (FTDI or PL2303) (optional)
- 2 x USB-C to USB-A Male Cable
- SD-card or NVMe drive (optional as eMMC is already provided)


Methods to enter Maskrom mode
-------------------------------

- Manually shorting the pads using the pogo pin.
- Interrupting the boot process by pressing ``rbrom`` shortcut key from serial console using keyboard.
- Enter maskrom mode from u-boot by running ``rbrom`` command from serial console.
- Pressing the recovery key to enter maskrom mode.

.. note::
    The ``rbrom`` command is only available in u-boot version 2017.09 or
