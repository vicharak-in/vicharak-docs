# Linux Upgrade Tool (upgrade_tool)

## What is Linux Upgrade Tool

Rockchip's **Linux Upgrade tool** is a proprietary solution developed by
Rockchip for flashing images onto various storage devices such as `SPI`,
`eMMC`, `SD-card`, and more. Unlike open-source
[rkdeveloptool](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkdeveloptool) software,
this tool does not provide access to its source code.

Instead, it is distributed solely in **binary executable** form,
allowing users to utilize the provided executable files for the purpose of
flashing images onto their desired storage devices.

## How to use Linux Upgrade Tool

3. Confirm that the board is in MaskROM mode by running the following command:

:::{card} sudo ./upgrade_tool ld

```bash
List of rockusb connected(1)
DevNo=1	Vid=0x2207,Pid=0x350b,LocationID=12	Mode=Maskrom	SerialNo=
```
:::

4. Using `uf` command, you can flash firmware in eMMC.

```bash
sudo ./upgrade_tool uf <Firmware_Image>.img
```
