You can use the Raspberry Pi Camera Module ``v1`` and ``v2`` with the
Vicharak Axon. The ``raspi`` camera module is a small circuit board
that connects to the CSI connector on the Axon and allows you to take
photos and videos.

We do not build or design the camera module, but we do test it for
compatibility with our Axon. We recommend buying the original camera
module from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, or from one of our authorized
resellers.

You can find more information about the camera module on the `Raspberry
Pi Camera documentation
<https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html>`_.

Buy the `Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2
<https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/>`_.

Run Camera Using Python Script
-------------------------------
 
1. Install Python if not already installed. You can download Python from the official website: `Python Downloads <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.
    
for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):   

.. code-block::

           sudo apt update
           sudo apt install python3-pip


2. Install the OpenCV library using pip
            
for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):

.. code-block::

           pip install opencv-python
            
Setup
------
    .. tab-set::
    
        .. tab-item:: 
1. Open a terminal window(``Ctrl+Alt+T``).

2. To create a (``.py``) file in vim editor, Run command ``vim <file_name>.py`` in terminal. 

3. Copy this below content into the file and paste it by pressing ``Ctrl + Shift + v``, then press ``Esc`` and to save this file, type ``:wq``.


.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 3

                # !/bin/env python3
                import cv2
                cap = cv2.VideoCapture(<camera_device_number>)
                while True:
                    ret, frame = cap.read()
                    cv2.imshow('frame', frame)
                    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                        break
                # After the loop release the cap object
                cap.release()
                # Destroy all the windows
                cv2.destroyAllWindows()
               
   
.. note::
        You can get <camera_device> Number by running below command :

        ls -l /dev/video*

        e.g. - 11, 31 etc.

4. Open a terminal window(``Ctrl+Alt+T``).

5. Navigate to the directory where your Python program is located using the ``cd`` command.

6. Run Python program using the following command:

.. code-block::

             python3 <file_name>.py


If you have multiple versions of Python installed, ensure you use ``python3`` to run the program for Python 3.x.

**Troubleshooting**


- If you encounter any errors related to missing modules or libraries, ensure that Python and OpenCV are properly installed on your system.
- If the camera frame does not open or the program does not behave as expected, check for any
  errors in the terminal output and review your program for potential issues.
- Check Camera I2C address is detected or not.

.. note::
    sudo i2cdetect -y <i2c_bus_number>
 
 I2C Bus number is mentioned in Camera DTS node in device tree file

- Camera Device can be find by :
    
.. note::
    ls -l /dev/video*

                  :width: 650
    
            3. The captured image will be saved in the current directory unless the directory location has been changed.
    
            4. Press the key ``Q`` on your keyboard to exit the camera frame.
            
    
            |
            **Troubleshooting**
