eMMC
#############

The Vicharak-Axon board exposes an eMMC 5.1 device connected to the SoC's MMC controller. It offers three capacity options: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB. The interface provides persistent storage for the operating system, user data, and diagnostics. eMMC 5.1 offers reliable multi-block read/write, boot partitions, and compatibility with standard MMC/SDHCI stacks in modern Linux kernels.

Hardware interface and pinout
-----------------------------

The eMMC interface is wired to the SoC MMC controller with the following essential signals:

- CMD: command/response line
- CLK: clock input
- DAT[0:7]: data lines (8-bit bus)
- VCC: core/eMMC supply
- VCCQ: I/O supply for the eMMC interface
- GND: ground reference
- RST: reset

Boot behavior and partitions
----------------------------

`You can find eMMC Flashing Guide here (Vicharak Docs) <https://docs.vicharak.in/vicharak_sbcs/axon/axon-linux/linux-usage-guide/>`_

Formatting and partitioning
---------------------------

- Partition the eMMC using standard partitioning tools (fdisk, sfdisk)
- Create filesystems as needed (ext4, btrfs, f2fs, etc.)

Software integration
--------------------

- Linux kernel MMC/SDHCI driver drives the eMMC interface and exposes the device as /dev/mmcblkX (and /dev/mmcblkXpN), use the command "lsblk"
- Device-tree entries describe the MMC controller, bus width, clock rates, and supply rails
- If using the eMMC as root filesystem, plan the partition layout accordingly and ensure bootloader configuration points to the correct root device

Troubleshooting
---------------

- If the eMMC is not detected, check kernel logs for MMC/SD/SDHCI messages to identify initialization or timing issues
- Ensure there are no contention issues with other peripherals sharing the same MMC controller
- Check for broken tracks or other hardware issues
