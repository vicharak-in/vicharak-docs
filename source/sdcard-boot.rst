Booting from SD-card
====================

**To make a SD-card bootable, follow these steps:**

Format the SD-card
------------------

Using a suitable file system (such as FAT32 or EXT4) format the SD-card.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Windows

        1. Insert the **SD-card** into your computer.

        4. Select the desired file system (e.g., FAT32) and click **Start**.

        5. Click **OK** to confirm the formatting.

    .. tab-item:: Linux

        .. tab-set::

            .. tab-item:: Gnome Disks (GUI)

                1. Insert the **SD-card** into your computer.

                2. Open the **Disks** application if you are using a GUI.

                3. Select the SD-card from the left panel.

                4. Click on the **Additional partition options** icon and select **Format Partition**.

                5. Select the desired file system (e.g., FAT32) and click **Next**.

                6. Click **Format** to confirm the formatting.

            .. tab-item:: GNU parted (CLI)

                1. Insert the **SD-card** into your computer.

                2. Open the **terminal** and run the following command to list the available disks:

                .. code-block:: console

                    sudo parted /dev/sdX


                .. image:: _static/images/parted-overview.webp
                   :width: 50%

                |

                3. the following command to **print** the partition table:

                .. code-block:: console

                    (parted) print

                |

                .. image:: _static/images/parted-partitions-list.webp
                   :width: 50%

                4. **Delete** the existing partitions using the following command:

                .. code-block:: console

                    (parted) rm 1
                    (parted) rm 2
                    ...

                5. After deleting all the partitions, the partition table should look like this:

                .. image:: _static/images/parted-deleted-partitions.webp
                   :width: 50%

                |

                6. Finally, **quit** the parted tool using the following command:

                .. code-block:: console

                    (parted) quit

            .. tab-item:: UNIX fdisk utility (CLI)

                1. Insert the **SD-card** into your computer.

                2. Open the **terminal** and run the following command to list the available disks:

                .. code-block:: console

                3. Press **d** to delete the existing partition. Do this for all the partitions.

                4. After deleting all the partitions, the partition table should be empty.

                5. Finally, press **w** to write the changes to the disk.


Download the bootable image
---------------------------

Obtain the bootable image or operating system files for your desired platform.

.. note::
    | For Vaaman, you can download the bootable image from the :ref:`Downloads <downloads>` page.
    | The bootable image is available in the `SD-card` section.

Write the image to the SD-card
------------------------------

.. warning::
    | Make sure you have selected the correct SD-card before writing the image.
    | Writing the image to the wrong SD-card will erase all the data on the SD-card.

You can use any disk imaging tool such as Etcher or Win32 Disk Imager to write the image to the SD-card.

For demonstration purposes, we will use the **Balena Etcher tool** to write the image to the SD-card.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Balena Etcher (GUI)

        1. Open the **Balena Etcher** tool.

        .. image:: _static/images/balena-start.webp
           :width: 50%

        |

        2. Click on **Select Image** and select the image file.

        .. image:: _static/images/balena-select-image.webp
           :width: 50%

        |

        3. Click on **Select Target** and select the SD-card.

        .. image:: _static/images/balena-select-storage.webp
           :width: 50%

        |

        4. Click on **Flash** to start writing the image to the SD-card.

        .. image:: _static/images/balena-start-flash.webp
           :width: 50%

        |

        5. Once the writing process is complete, click on **Done**.

        .. image:: _static/images/balena-flash-complete.webp
           :width: 50%

    .. tab-item:: UNIX **dd** command (CLI)

        1. Open the **terminal** and run the following command to write the image to the SD-card:

        .. code-block:: console

            sudo dd if=/path/to/image of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress; sync

        .. note::
            | Replace **/path/to/image** with the path to the image file.
            | Replace **sdX** with the correct SD-card.

        2. Wait for the writing process to complete.

        3. Once the writing process is complete, Safely eject the **SD-card** from your computer.

Boot from the SD-card
---------------------

After writing the image to the SD-card, follow these steps to boot from the SD-card:

1. Safely eject the **SD-card** from your computer.

2. Insert the **SD-card** into your Vaaman SBC.

|

3. **Power-on** the device to initiate the boot process from the SD-card.

Connect the PD cable to the Vaaman SBC and the PD adapter to the power socket.
Once the power is connected, the board will automatically turn on.

    12V Power Input only! Do not use 5V power input.
